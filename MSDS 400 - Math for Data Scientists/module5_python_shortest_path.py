       This is a class that represents a node. The functions of a class are called methods. Instantiations of this class

       For the Node object, we care about the name of the node and a dictionary naming the adjacent nodes. The adjacent
       dictionary keys will be the name's of adjacent nodes and the value will be the weight of that edge.
